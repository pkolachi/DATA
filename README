This data was collected during an experiment aiming at automatically translating a novel.
More precisely a pipeline machine translation + post-editing was used and evaluated (MT+PE).
This repository is organized as follows:

- EN : The source data in English (the novel segmented into segments)
	source.all : initial text
	source.pre.all : tokenized text
	tier1, tier2 and tier3 correspond to 3 blocs of equivalent size (because after 1st bloc is translated, the MT system is adapated ; then second bloc is translated, etc. - see associated paper for more details)

- FR : The target data in French
	MT : MT outputs for the 3 iterations of the translation process
	(hyp.all refers to the whole novel automatically translated with system of iteration i)
	PE : Post-edited outputs from each MT outputs
	(reference.all refers to the whole novel translated + post-edited)

- NouvelleTraduiteFR.pdf : is the final translated novel in French that was obtained after 25h of human work (15h postedition + 10h revision)

- Survey.ods : is the result of a survey done by 9 readers of the French translated novel (NouvelleTraduiteFR.pdf) 

-taln-besacier.pdf : is the paper describing this work (in French)

  abstract = {{C}urrent machine translation ({MT} ) techniques are continuously improving. {I}n specific areas, post-editing ({PE}) allows to obtain high-quality translations relatively quickly. {B}ut is such a pipeline ({MT}+{PE}) usable to translate a lite- rary work (fiction, short story) ? {T}his paper tries to bring a preliminary answer to this question. {A} short story by {A}merican writer {R}ichard {P}owers, still not available in {F}rench, is automatically translated and post-edited and then revised by non- professional translators. {T}he {LIG} post-editing platform allows to read and edit the short story suggesting (for the future) a community of readers-editors that continuously improve the translations of their favorite author. {I}n addition to presen- ting experimental evaluation results of the pipeline {MT}+{PE} ({MT} system used, auomatic evaluation), we also discuss the quality of the translation output from the perspective of a panel of readers (who read the translated short story in {F}rench, and answered to a survey afterwards). {F}inally, some remarks of the official french translator of {R}. {P}owers, requested on this occasion, are given at the end of this article.},
