This data was collected during an experiment aiming at automatically translating a novel.
More precisely a pipeline machine translation + post-editing was used and evaluated (MT+PE).
This repository is organized as follows:

- EN : The source data in English (the novel segmented into segments)
	source.all : initial text
	source.pre.all : tokenized text
	tier1, tier2 and tier3 correspond to 3 blocs of equivalent size (because after 1st bloc is translated, the MT system is adapated ; then second bloc is translated, etc. - see associated paper for more details)

- FR : The target data in French
	MT : MT outputs for the 3 iterations of the translation process
	(hyp.all refers to the whole novel automatically translated with system of iteration i)
	PE : Post-edited outputs from each MT outputs
	(reference.all refers to the whole novel translated + post-edited)

- NouvelleTraduiteFR.pdf : is the final translated novel in French that was obtained after 25h of human work (15h postedition + 10h revision)

- Survey.ods : is the result of a survey done by 9 readers of the French translated novel (NouvelleTraduiteFR.pdf) 

-taln-besacier.pdf : is the paper describing this work (in French) 

-WSliterature.pdf : is the paper describing this work (in English)
